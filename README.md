A torrent streaming media player built in NW.js with peerflix .

## Interface

1) Add Magnet Link :


2) Start Buffering and playing :

## Issues

1. Incase, video doesn't buffer ; thats probably because of a new `peerflix` upgrade . So , then you can re-install peerflix or do a simple `npm update` and you should be good to go .

2. I am using the WebChimera player currently and working on a custom HTML5 player with a libvlc wrapper .
